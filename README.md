Playlist and Favorites: Supports showing/hiding the playlist and marking songs as favorites.
UI Components: Integrates several child components (PlayerHeader, CoverArt, SongInfo, PlayerControls, ProgressBar, VolumeControl, Playlist, PlayerActions) to build the user interface.
Audio Management: Uses the HTML <audio> element with React refs and event handlers to control playback and respond to user actions.
